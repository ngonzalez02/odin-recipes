    <li><h3>Toast the broth ingredients:</h3>
    In a pot, toast the coriander seeds and clove over medium heat until fragrant, 1 to 2 minuts. THen add the ginger and green onions. Stir for about 30 seconds.</li>
    <li><h3>Add the brotth and bring to simmer:</h3>
    Slide pot off heat, wait 15 seconds or so to briefly cool, then pour in the broth. 
    Return the pot the burner, then add the water, cilantro sprigs, chicken, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat to gently simmer.</li>
    <li><h3>Remove the chicken from the broth once cooked:</h3>
    After 5-10 minutes of simmering, the chicken should be firm and cooked through. </li>
    <li><h3>Simmer the broth:</h3>
    Continue to simmer the broth without the chicken for another 15-20 minutes.</li>
    <li><h3>Shred the Chicken:</h3>
    Transfer the chicken to a bowl, flush with cold water to arrest the cooking, then drain. Let cool, then cut or shred into bite-size pieves. Cover loosely to prevent drying</li>
    <li><h3>Soak the rice noodles:</h3> 
    Soak the rice noodles in hot water until pliable and opaque. Drain, rinse, and set aside. </li>
    <li><h3>Strain the broth:</h3>
    When the broth is done, pour it through a fine-mesh strainer positioned over a pot; line the strainer with muslin for super clear broth. Discard the solids. You should have about 4 cups.
    Season with fish sauce and sugar, if needed.</li>
    <li><h3>Finish the pho:</h3>
    Bring the strained broth to a boil over high heat. Put the noodles in a noodle strainer and dunk in the hot broth to heat and soften, 5 to 60 seconds. Lift the noodles from the pot and divide between the 2 bowls.
    Lower the heat to keep the broth hot while you arrange the chicken on top of the noodles and garnish thm with green onion, cilantro, and sprinkling of pepper. Taste and adjust the saltiness as needed. Enjoy!</li>
